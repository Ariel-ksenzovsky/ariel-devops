# code 1:
for i in range(1, 10):
 if i % 2 == 0:
   print(i * i)
### the code make variable "1" to run 
# between number 1 and 9 and check every time if "i"
# an even number and if it's even then print the number in a square ###

# Code 2:
word = "hello"
new_word = word[1:] + word[0]
print(new_word)

### the code put the word "hello" in an variable named "word", 
# and then we defines new variable named "new_word" and puts in it the varible "word" except the
# first character and merge to it the first charcter from the variable "word"
# in the end itn print the varible "new_word" and it is the word "elloh"###

# Code 3:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [n ** 2 for n in numbers if n % 2 == 1]
print(squared_numbers)

### the output will be the square of the odds numbers ###

# Code 4:
    
fruits = {"apple": 3, "banana": 5, "cherry": 2}
total = 0
for fruit in fruits:
 total += fruits[fruit]
print(total)

### the code will print the number 10, 
# the code calculating the values for every key summerize it in variable "total" ###

text = "Python"
result = ""
for char in text:
 result = char + result
print(result)

### the will be "nohtyP" (the reverse word "Python")
# the code run put each character from the variable "text" (the word "python" is in variable text) 
# and it put every character right before the proviouscharacter ###

set_a = {1, 2, 3}
set_b = {2, 3, 4}
result = set_a.symmetric_difference(set_b)
print(result)

### the output will be {1, 4},
# the "symmetric_difference" return to the variable "result" the diffrent values between the sets we provid ###
